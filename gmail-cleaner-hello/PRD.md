# Gmail Storage Manager - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

A Python-based application that automatically downloads old Gmail messages to local storage and safely deletes them from Gmail to free up cloud storage space. The app provides intelligent filtering, backup verification, and batch processing capabilities.

## Problem Statement

Gmail users with long-term accounts frequently hit storage limits (15GB across Google services). Manually managing old emails is time-consuming and risky:
- Gmail's web interface limits bulk operations
- Risk of accidentally deleting important emails
- No easy way to archive emails locally while freeing cloud space
- Difficulty identifying which emails are safe to delete

## Target Users

- **Primary**: Long-term Gmail users approaching storage limits
- **Secondary**: Users wanting to create local email archives
- **Tertiary**: Organizations needing email retention policies

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Goals
- Reduce Gmail storage usage by 50-90%
- Preserve 100% of downloaded email data integrity
- Zero data loss during deletion process
- Automate 95% of the email management workflow

### Success Metrics
- Storage freed per execution cycle
- Number of emails safely archived
- User-reported time savings

### 7. Search & Browse Interface
**Priority: P1**
- Full-text search of archived emails
- Web-based local email browser
- Advanced filtering and sorting
- Export individual emails back to formats

### 8. Automation & Scheduling
**Priority: P1**
- Scheduled automatic runs (weekly/monthly)
- Storage threshold triggers
- Email age-based automation
- Custom automation rules

### 9. Reporting & Analytics
**Priority: P2**
- Storage usage trends
- Email volume analytics
- Sender/recipient analysis
- Archive growth tracking

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **Gmail API Client**: Handle authentication and email operations
- **Download Engine**: Multi-threaded email fetching
- **Storage Manager**: Local file system and database management
- **Filter Engine**: Rule-based email categorization
- **Deletion Controller**: Safe batch deletion with verification
- **Security Module**: Encryption and authentication handling

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.9+
- **Gmail Integration**: Google Gmail API
- **Database**: SQLite for metadata, filesystem for emails
- **Security**: cryptography library for encryption
- **UI**: Optional web interface (Flask/FastAPI)
- **Configuration**: YAML/JSON config files

### Data Flow
1. Authenticate with Gmail API
2. Query emails based on filters
3. Download emails in batches
4. Verify download integrity
5. Store locally with encryption
6. Mark for deletion in Gmail
7. Execute deletion with verification
8. Update local database and logs

## Security Requirements

### Data Protection
- All local emails encrypted at rest
- Secure API credential storage
- No logging of email content
- Local-only processing (no cloud dependencies)

### Access Control
- OAuth 2.0 with minimal required scopes
- Secure token refresh handling
- Session timeout and re-authentication
- Audit trail for all operations

### Privacy
- No external data transmission except Gmail API
- Configurable data retention policies
- Secure deletion of temporary files
- User consent for all operations

## User Experience

### Installation & Setup
1. Install via pip or standalone executable
2. Run setup wizard for Gmail authentication
3. Configure initial filters and preferences
4. Test run with small batch
5. Schedule regular operations

### Configuration Options
- **Storage location**: Local directory for archives
- **Retention rules**: What to keep vs delete
- **Filter presets**: Common use cases (newsletters, old emails, etc.)
- **Safety settings**: Backup verification levels
- **Automation**: Scheduling and triggers

### Monitoring & Control
- Real-time progress monitoring
- Pause/resume operations
- Emergency stop functionality
- Detailed logging and reporting
- Storage usage dashboard

## Risk Mitigation

### Data Loss Prevention
- Multiple verification steps before deletion
- Backup integrity checks
- Rollback capabilities
- Test mode for new users
- Gradual deletion with user approval

### API Rate Limiting
- Respect Gmail API quotas
- Exponential backoff on errors
- Batch size optimization
- Progress persistence across sessions

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error logging
- Automatic retry logic
- Graceful degradation
- User notification system

## Success Criteria

### MVP (Phase 1)
- [ ] Download emails older than specified date
- [ ] Verify download integrity
- [ ] Safely delete from Gmail
- [ ] Basic filtering (date, size, sender)
- [ ] Command-line interface

### V1.0 (Phase 2)
